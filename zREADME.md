  ## Structure
The website is designed to be consistent, intuitive and learnable.
- Interaction design
  - For predictability, the interface interacts with user actions as the user expects. The scroll/swipe actions respond with the normal behaviour and buttons acts instantly on press.
  - For consistency, the interface offers a subtle visual feedback to the user (on hover, focus and press of buttons and fields) which is similar throughout the application and helps the user to quickly learn the functionality.
- Information architecture
  - The content is organised and prioritised by importance from top to bottom and left to right.
  - The information is structured mostly in nested lists.
